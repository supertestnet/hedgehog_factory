# Hedgehog factory
It's like tornado factory but for hedgehog channels, and I added a coordinator

Hedgehog factory improves on tornado factory in three ways:

(1) it has real, usable channels now, not just a random utxo you get to withdraw (though the channels are currently receive-only)

(2) users can run the app separately now and coordinate over the internet to do the funding transaction (in Tornado Factory, all users are just different pubkeys generated by the same page, so it's really just one user with n pubkeys)

(3) I implemented a massive efficiency gain by delegating *one* person to do the funding transaction and having everyone else *pay him over lightning* as a kind of admission-fee to the pool. This makes it so that n channels are opened with a single transaction needing only one input and two outputs (the multisig and some change).

This greatly reduces the cost of channel opens *and* gives people an opportunity to make money on their bitcoin. E.g. if a btc transaction costs $10, you can make money on your bitcoin offering more than 10 people the opportunity to open a channel in a pool where you are the delegate, and then you just charge each person a $1 admission fee. Everyone wins: you make money, and they each get a channel for $1 that would have costed them $10 otherwise.

So that's what I'm currently building in Hedgehog Factory: a tool where you can invite people to enter a pool where you perform the funding transaction and charge an "admission fee" to recoup your costs and hopefully make something extra.
